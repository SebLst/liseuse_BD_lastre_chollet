## Dependencies

See wxWidgets dependencies based on your OS: https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/

On linux
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk-3-dev
```

## Build

After cloning the repo, don't forget to run the following to get the external dependencies.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd external/wxWidgets
git submodule init
git submodule update
``` 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 8
./cbreader
```
The ```-j 8``` flag is not necessary but we strongly recommend you to use it as it might take you a minute or two otherwise.
